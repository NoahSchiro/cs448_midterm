Split the three algorithms among the three of us:

- [ ] Bayesian Classifier
- [ ] SVM
- [ ] Linear / Logisitc Regression (for this task, likely a logisitic regression)

Ideas for maximizing performance:
I don't think it'll be enough to just pass in the word and expect it to predict the part of speech, we might want to incorporate positional encoding as well (where the word is in the sentence) or maybe what words came before or after the word?
